A Widget for AY 218 Galaxies course.

Here, I use a 3 component model to simulate the observed rotation curve of a spiral galaxy. 
The rotation curves or velocity curves are computed assuming a virialized system. 

Component 1: Dark Matter halo, whose density profile follows a power law. One can adjust the scale radius and power of the dark matter halo density profile. Note that the velocity is computed by integrating the densities over a spherically symmetric distribution.

Component 2: Disk, following an exponentially decaying density profile.

Component 3: Galactic Bulge, assuming a spherical mass distribution. Galactic bulge is not working particularly well, as my density profile is not well behaved. Can be turned off by setting corresponding slider to 0.
